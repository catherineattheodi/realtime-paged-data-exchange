    # Introduction

    ## OpenActive

    The W3C OpenActive Community Group was established with the objective of facilitating the sharing and use of physical activity data. This data is currently largely closed, and open publishing of this data has enormous potential to increase participation in physical activities.

    OpenActive specifications are modular, each focussing on a specific use cases regarding physical activity data.

    Other aspects of the Community Group's work includes the collation and specification of test suites to assess conformance to referenced standards, and the specification of a framework within which such conformance testing might be assessed are referenced.

    ## Use case and requirements

    Booking systems contains session data (a specific event at a time in a location). Examples include bookable squash courts, Yoga classes, and running groups.

    ### Realtime
    This session data is frequently updated, as sessions are booked, descriptions changed. The data must be available as close to real-time as possible.

    ### Simplicity of implementation
    Many booking systems are maintained by an agency or supplier, and changes are funded by organisations with a small budgets. Hence simplicity and speed of implementation is paramount.

    ### Flexibility of interface
    Due to the cost of work on the booking system side, this interface must not be a constraint to innovation. Innovators should be able to easily implement novel solutions on top of the data without additional effort on the booking system side. This means ideally pushing all query complexity out of the booking system in order to maximise flexibility, and providing a simple sync.

    ## Scope

    This specification is tightly defined to cover data exchange and synchronisation itself; to cover the real-time exchange of generic entities between two systems.

    ### Goals

    - Sharing of session data, including related metadata (clubs, courses, membership requirements, skill level, cost), and events (e.g. open days).
    - Paging and synchronisation to ensure robust incremental transport of data.
    - Allows a client to "refresh its cache", by providing the facility to download all data.
    - (Stretch goal) Extendable to support real-time, high volume data transfer, to satisfy peak load requirements.


    ### Non-Goals

    - User Authentication.
    - Booking and payment.
    - Availability of courts and facilities.
    - Membership packages.
    - Standardisation of content (e.g. "Football" = "Soccer").


    ## Objectives

    - Easy to understand
    - Simple to implement (does not require complex libraries)
    - Based on existing standards where possible
    - Minimalistic (focus on removing complexity)
    - Minimise traffic between services
    - Robust to errors and failed requests
    - Capable of scaling to handle high volumes

    </section>
    <section id='conformance'>

    This specification describes the conformance criteria for OpenActive data synchronisation endpoints.

    </section>

    # Overall approach

    In order to create a simple specification that is robust and scalable, the transport mechanism is separated from the paged exchange specifics. By applying paging to all transport alternatives, the approach is inherently scalable.

    The specification is split into the three labelled elements of <a href='#fig-elements-of-this-specification'></a>.

      ![](images/image02.png)
      <figcaption>Elements of this specification</figcaption>
    </figure>



    # Paging

    A paged approach to [[!JSON]] data exchange is used, requiring minimum traffic for real-time or near-real-time synchronisation.


    ## Simplicity

    The paged [[!JSON]] data exchange standard is incredibly simple to implement, but conceptually requires some explanation.

    ## Core concept

    Consider an ordered list as shown in <a href='#fig-illustration-of-the-deterministic-list'></a>, with the following invariants:

    - A continuous list of records that MUST be sorted deterministically and chronological (in the order they were updated). Either (i) ordered first by modified timestamp, and second by ID or (ii) ordered by an incrementing counter where records are assigned a new unique value on each update.

    - Every record MUST only be represented *once* in this list at a given moment, with its position in the list depending on when it was last updated. Records can freely move position in the list as they are updated.

    - This deterministic ordering based on timestamp allows for pages of arbitrary size to be sent without concern for race conditions; if a record is updated during the transfer of a page it MUST appear on a subsiquent page (i.e. simply reappear further down the list).

    - Pages are defined using a "next page URL", which MUST contain enough information to identify a position in the list (e.g. by a "timestamp" and "ID" combination). It MUST NOT reference a specific record, as that record can change position in the list.

    - If a "next page URL" is not used to access the list, the first page MUST be returned.

    - If the consumer reaches the end of the list they consider themselves up-to-date at that moment, and can frequently revisit the end of the list in order to retrieve further updates.

    - If any record is added to the list, it MUST remain in the list in perpetuity with either an `updated` or a `deleted` state. This ensures that deletions are synchronised to data consumers.

    This paging allows for an ongoing data synchronisation that synchronises all data, which can be replayed arbitrarily by the client.


    ## Ordering strategies

    Two recommended ordering strategies are described below, both adhere to the specified invariants described in the previous section. One of these two strategies SHOULD be used as a basis for any implementation, unless the invariants are well understood and the implementation can be thoroughly tested.

    For both these ordering strategies the ordering of the results relative to the parameters MUST be implemented exactly as described here.


    ### Modified Timestamp and ID

    The content of a [[!JSON]] depends on the supplied parameters, as specified below.

Parameter | Implementation | Notes
--- | ---
`afterTimestamp` | REQUIRED | The modified timestamp, after which results will be returned (if not specified will return from beginning of time)
`afterId` | REQUIRED | The ID after which results will be returned (if not specified will return all).
`limit` | OPTIONAL | The number of records returned with in the page. A suggested default for most opportunity data sources is 500 records.


    In this example, `afterTimestamp=1453931925&afterId=12` would return **Page 2** labelled in <a href='#fig-illustration-of-the-deterministic-list'></a>. hence the last record of a returned page of results can be used as parameters to retrieve the next page of results.

    Note that the timestamp does not need to reflect actual time, as long as it providers a chronological ordering. An integer, string or other representation is sufficient, provided it is sufficiently comparable to support the invariants.


    <figure>
      ![](images/image00.png)
      <figcaption>Illustration of the deterministic list</figcaption>
    </figure>

    #### SQL Query Example

    Where a table exists containing `modified` and `id` columns.

    ```SQL
    --include WHERE clause only if @afterTimestamp and @afterId provided
    WHERE (modified = @afterTimestamp AND id > @afterId) OR (modified > @afterTimestamp)
    ORDER BY modified, id
    ```

    <div class="note">
    Misreading this query is the single most common cause of incorrect implementation. Please read it carefully and ensure that brackets and comparitors are used correctly. `>` not `>=` for example.
    </div>


    #### JavaScript Query Example

    Where a table or collection exists containing `modified` and `id` columns or properties.

    ```javascript
    var query;
    if (queryParams.from) {
        query = Session.query().filter((Session.modified == queryParams.afterTimestamp && Session.id > queryParams.afterId) || (Session.modified > queryParams.afterTimestamp));
    } else {
        query = Session.query()
    }
    return query.sort([Session.modified, Session.id])
    ```



    ### Incrementing Unique Change Number

    The content of a [[!JSON]] page depends on the supplied parameters, as specified below.

Parameter | Implementation | Notes
--- | ---
`afterChangeNumber` | REQUIRED | An integer after which results will be returned (if not specified will return starting with the first change number).
`limit` | OPTIONAL | The number of records returned with in the page. A suggested default for most opportunity data sources is 500 records.

    The change number MUST provide a deterministic chronological ordering within the scope of the endpoint. A database-wide counter is sufficient (such as SQL Server's [timestamp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776%28v=SQL.90%29.aspx) or [rowversion](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms182776.aspx)). The consumer ("System 2") simply maintains the "next page URL", so the detail of the change number is transparent in thier implementation.

    The items `id` (unique idenfier which is distinct from the change number) MUST be included within the item, to allow items to be uniquely idenified for the purposes of update and delete operations.

    The `modified` property MUST still be included, and set to the change number, to allow items with identical `id`s from different pages to be compared to calculate which is newer.

    In this example, `afterChangeNumber=1453931931` would return **Page 2** labelled in <a href='#fig-illustration-of-the-deterministic-list-via-change-number'></a>. hence the last record of a returned page of results can be used as parameters to retrieve the next page of results.

    <figure>
      ![](images/image03.png)
      <figcaption>Illustration of the deterministic list via change number</figcaption>
    </figure>

    #### SQL Query Example

    Where a table exists containing a `change_number` column.

    ```SQL
    WHERE change_number > @afterTimestamp --include WHERE clause only if @afterTimestamp provided
    ORDER BY change_number
    ```

    #### JavaScript Query Example

    Where a table or collection exists containing a `changeNumber` column or property.

    ```javascript
    var query;
    if (queryParams.from) {
        query = Session.query().filter(Session.changeNumber > queryParams.afterChangeNumber);
    } else {
        query = Session.query()
    }
    return query.sort([Session.changeNumber])
    ```


    ## Related entities

    This specification can be implemented for each relevant entity type within System 1 (e.g. club, courses, sessions).

    Data from related entities can either be:

    1. **Embedded inside the parent entity**. This requires the parent "updated" field to reflect the maximum value of all children - achievable via database triggers or similar.

    1. **Provided by separate endpoints** implementing this specification, the combination of which can be reassembled by System 2.


    Entities that have similar update frequency (e.g. Event and Location) MUST be embedded in the same endpoint.

    Entiries with substantially different update frequencies (e.g. Event Description and Availability) SHOULD be provided as separate endpoints. The specification does not advocate embedding of child entities if they change substantially more frequently than the parent. Each entity type endpoint and ("kind") can be synchronised separately, this allows a decoupling of the sync logic from the data structure, and allows us to reassemble the data structure on the client side. It also makes the implementation very simple.




    ## Response grammar

    It should be noted that although the `<data>` element is open to conformance with [[JSON-LD]], the properties in this specification do not use any part of the [[JSON-LD]] specification.

    Endpoints MUST NOT include JSON-LD syntax except for within the `data` property.


    ### `<response>`


    ```JSON
    <response> => {
          "next": "/getSessions?afterTimestamp=<date>&afterId=<id>",
          "items": [<item>,<item>,<item>,...],
          "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
       }
    ```

    A generic response specification is included here, in order to standardise the transport encapsulation for the records across entities and systems - including paging and polling logic, for example.

Property | Status | Notes
--- | ---
`next` | <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em> | This MUST be an absolute URL, fully qualified with the domain. For polling, the "next" URL in the response is a precomputed next URL that would be called by the client to get the next page (which would be polled after a delay if the previous page had returned no data). Note "polling" and "paging" are differentiated only by the duration between requests. Although an example endpoint name is provided, this is outside the scope of this standard.
`items` | <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em> | An array of `<item>`, which should simply by empty `[]` if no results are returned.
[`license`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/license) | <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em> | Reference to the license under which the data has been published


    ### `<item>`


    ```
    <item> => {
          state: 'updated' | 'deleted',
          kind: "session",
          id: <id>, 
          modified: <modified>,
          data: <data>
       }
    ```


Property | Status | Notes
--- | ---
`state` | REQUIRED | MUST be of value `"updated"` or value `"deleted"`. Deleted items are included in the response with a "deleted" state, but no `<data>` associated.
`kind` | REQUIRED | The "kind" property allows for the representation of different entity types. The specification does not advocate embedding of child entities if they change more frequently than the parent. Each entity type ("kind") can be synchronised separately, this allows us to decouple the sync logic from the data structure, and allows us to reassemble the data structure on the client side. It also makes the implementation very simple.
`id` | REQUIRED | Although IDs shown here are GUIDs, and above are numeric, and although the example above shows Unix timestamps, the standard does not prescribe any specific format of either.
`modified` | REQUIRED | Modified timestamp or change number of the item. Must be comparable to itself. The value of the relevant item MUST be used in either the `afterTimestamp` or `afterChangeNumber` parameter, in the same format.
`data` | REQUIRED | Note this property MUST NOT be included if state is `'deleted'`


    ### `<data>`

    The `<data>` part of the response is open for applications for populate with whatever data structure is most appropriate for the entity type ("kind") being exchanged. 
    
    Applications SHOULD use a standard data model to increase interoperability of the exchanged data. For example an application may choose to use entities and properties defined in [[SCHEMA-ORG]] to help structure data in a useful way for reusers. 
    
    Applications that are exchanging data about entities described in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] SHOULD ensure that their data conforms to that specification. 
    This includes data on Events, Organisations, Places, etc. [[Publishing-Opportunity-Data]] provides additional examples and guidance on using that data model 
    in ways that are compatible with the other standards publishing by OpenActive.
    
    Applications that publish data using bespoke data models SHOULD provide users with relevant documentation.
    
    <div class="note">
    The remainder of this specification uses simple examples when showing `<data>` elements in responses. However these examples are for illustrative purposes only. For a comprehensive selection of examples of opportunity data, read the [[Publishing-Opportunity-Data]] primer.

    # Transport

    ## Polling

    Polling mechanics and expected consumer behaviour is defined in this section.

    ### Initial download

    The pages are first downloaded to catchup with the current state of System 1. This is achieved by following the `next` property of each page until the last page is reached.

    ### Last page definition

    The last page MUST have the following properties:

    - The `items` property is an empty array.
    - The `next` property matches the URL of the page.


    ### Near real-time updates

    The consumer MUST poll the endpoint at the "last page" URL to check for updates using exponential backoff (wait 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds etc) to minimum polling frequency. When items are found, it SHOULD resume the behavoiur of the initial download: following the `next` property of each page. 

    ### In-stream filtering

    The `items` property being empty is not sufficient to indicate the last page, as in-stream filtering is permitted on items within the page such that a page may appear to contain zero items, but specify a valid `next` URL distinct from the URL of the page.

    <figure>
      ![](images/image04.png)
      <figcaption>Illustration of in-stream filtering</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Although a full page may be presented from System 1 to the filter, the filter may exclude all items within the list, resulting in a zero-item array at System 2.

    Note that any items allowed to pass through the filter once MUST perpetually be allowed to pass through the filter, with a `"deleted"` state for those that would otherwise be filtered out. This is in keeping with the invarient described in the <a href='#core-concept'>core concept</a>, ensuring that System 2 correctly deletes records that have been modified such that they are subsequently filtered out.

    ## Other transport mechanisms

    Note that although this specification has been built to cater for other types of transport, it focusses on polling as the primary transport mechanism. The exploration of other transport mechanisms is encouraged for usecases that require higher throughput. To support additional testing and experimentation of new transport mechanisms, a "beta" wiki has been defined to allow the community to explore such mechanisms collaboratively. For more information on the process supporting that see [[OpenActive-RPDE-Wiki]].

    # Implementation

    ## Common implmentation issues

    This specification is simple to implement, however such implmentation requires precision to ensure that it is robust. The most common issues encountered during implementations are enumerated here:

    - The <a href='#last-page-definition'>last page</a> must have zero items, and a correct next URL that matches the current request.
    - The <a href='#sql-query-example'>query</a> must be correctly implemented with the parentheses in the correct positions.
    - The <a href='#core-concept'>core concept</a> must be understood, specifically the nature of the list of records where each record appears only once, and each record exists in perpetuity within the feed (with the deleted flag implemented).
    - The <a href='#-item-'>`modified`</a> value (used for either the `afterTimestamp` or `afterChangeNumber` parameter) must always be updated when any data within the `data` property is updated. This can be achieved through e.g. adding triggers to update the modified date on the primary table for related changes.
    - The <a href='#-item-'>`modified`</a> value should match the format used in the `afterTimestamp` or `afterChangeNumber`. 


    ## Patterns of implementation

    Three common patterns of implementation are presented, along with specific advantages and disadvantages of each, together with miscellaneous notes.

    ### Single JSON entity cache table

    Create a cache table which is written to on each entity change (or related entity change, if a calculated field is created), either via an application or database trigger (which can also be used to trigger the webhook). The table contains the rendered [[!JSON]] `<item>`, along with the modified timestamp and the ID.

    Entries in the table overwrite old items with a newer modified timestamp.

    This table can be easily parsed into output for the client. This has the advantage of allowing one endpoint and one process to manage the real-time sync by watching this single table, as the table can maintain a sort and page across all entity "kinds".


    ### Multiple table on-demand JSON generation

    The [[!JSON]] is generated from each table individually at the point that is requested by either the webhook or poll.

    An endpoint will be required for each entity "kind", as the sort cannot efficiently happen across tables. These endpoints would require separate webhook / polling processes to keep them in sync (though the webhooks can all share the same endpoint on the client).


    ### Hybrid approach: paging table

    A paging table could be created that contains only the Kind, Modified Timestamp and ID. This table is then updated with each entity update, however the [[!JSON]] is only generated on-demand by getting the next page from the paging table and rendering [[!JSON]] for each of IDs of the "kinds" returned.


    ## Additional notes

    ### Calculated fields (e.g. available spaces or available tickets for a session)

    As some entities will not need to be synchronised, but fields calculated from them will need to be known to the client (e.g. the "tickets" table may not need to be synchronised, but the "available tickets" calculated field on the "sessions" table will be required).

    The suggested approach is to calculate the field "available tickets" and store it in the "sessions" table on each ticket sale. This has three advantages:

    - It keeps the application logic for such calculation together with the original action.
    - It creates a cached value that can be used in other parts of the application to increase performance.
    - It prevents the creation of complex calculations which are used only on-demand for the purposes of data synchronisation.

    An alternative could be to calculate it on each synchronisation, however this will slow down the sync. Assuming that reads will occur on this calculated data more frequently than writes, caching the calculated field is recommended.


    ### Strict ordering of items

    For high-throughput AMQP, when updating data in the client's index, the timestamp of each record will be used to ensure records are only updated with newest data. Although this technique can be used specifically for AMQP, all other methods of transport must adhere to a strict ordering of items by modified timestamp and ID (per kind) in order to ensure data consistency. Ordering between kinds is not important.


    ### Database Triggers (MS SQL Server example)

    If using a
     [timestamp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776%28v=SQL.90%29.aspx)/[rowversion](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms182776.aspx) field on the parent table as the "modified timestamp", using the trigger below for each child table will update the rowversion field in the relevant rows on the parent table when the child table is updated.

    The `SET SomeColumn = SomeColumn` part of this trigger could easily be replaced with setting materialised calculated fields (e.g. "total number of tickets sold") which contain the summary data required by "System 2". This reduces the need to join the child table during the API endpoint response, which helps to optimise the endpoint.

    The example below has been adapted from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2165333/how-to-update-sql-server-timestamp-column-without-changing-record-data), see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191300.aspx) for an explanation of the mechanics.

    ```
    CREATE TRIGGER tgUpdateParentRowVersion ON ChildTable FOR INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE
    AS
    BEGIN
       /*
        * The updates below force the update of the parent table rowversion
        */

       /* Materialised field calculation goes here*/

       UPDATE ParentTable
          SET SomeColumn = SomeColumn
         FROM ParentTable a
         JOIN inserted    i on a.pkParentTable = i.fkParentTable

       UPDATE ParentTable
          SET SomeColumn = SomeColumn
         FROM ParentTable a
         JOIN deleted     d on a.pkParentTable = d.fkParentTable
    END

    ```
